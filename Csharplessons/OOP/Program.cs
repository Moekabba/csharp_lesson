// oop princples 
// Encapsulation: data is contained insode an object (hiding information)
// Abstraction : Classes expose what they can do, not how they do it
// Inheritance : Derived classes inherit the structure and behavior of parents class
// polymorphism: Classes sharing the same structure can be exchange/ one thing that can act differently

//==== OOp importance ============
//Modularity : Data encapsulation results in self-containing objects. It simplifies software development
// Resuability : classes can be shared across applications. DRY
// Productivity: Reusable building blocks help devellpers build aplications quicklt

// == Disadvantage of oop ====
// Focus on data: does not care enough about computation or algorithms
// oop code is lengthy : Code is lengthy and complicated to implement
// Longer compile times: was a issues but all good now

// == Functional programing is another programing paradigm option
// C# is a multi-paradigm language

// What is classes in c#? example 

// Objects
// Properties
// Methods 
// Reference types 
// Namespace 
// interfaces
// Fields 
// Properties and
// construction
// Access modifiers
// Static members
// Advance Variable Scopes 
// Inheritance 
// Polymorphism
